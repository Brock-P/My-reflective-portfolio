- Note Stuff that I have learned has been on a seperate document and updated.
Week 1 

What have I learnt this week?
I learnt this week what systems are and the types of systems. Mainly, the Main types of systems mainly complex adaptive systems and complicated systems. Similarly, how emergence can come from types on systems. An example of this is how ants can form a kind of a higher intelligence as they work together which can divert expectation as alone they are not as intelligent.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
How systems are all around us and constantly affect our day to day lives. Without systems many of our contemporary world ideals and structure would crumble without systems and its many properties. Furthermore, my way of thinking has changed to look into the details of a systems and its many components instead of looking at the system as a whole. Looking at the whole system can make it very complicated to visualise. 

What insights have I gained?
some insights that I have gained is to find the system boundary. As I am new to this way of thinking fiding the cut off in a system really helps me understand the system. An example of this was a practice question on a city system. As I tried to visualise and think about the system I found myself down the rabbit hole as I could not put a boundary on the system to help me answer the question. Moreover, the property of emergence has truly been deepened. As I found and interest on the subject further reading and learning really helped me understand how emergence can come of systems.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
As stated before I have a theme of overthinking the way a system works. In changing the way I think and making things simple I have found looking at systems to be much more eaiser than before. This understanding demonstrates both weakness through my overthinking but also strength as I over came this issue through the help of advisors and peers by thinking more simply. 

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As this is my first lecture at Uni I found it to be quite the step up from previous learning. Especially the longer hours in classes. However, for me to understand the importance of learning and having my peers being in the same boat I focussed. This was handled to a good degree as we as a group create groups to contact each other for help.
A similar challenged faced was not knowing how to take notes. Considering the very long classes and more conversation, writing too much became an issue for me as I burned out quickly as I wrote too many notes. It was handled poorly through my stubborness to conitue writing too much burning me out qucikly.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time would be to pace myself. Being excited with my first class I seemed to have gone to quickly. Therefore, next time I would pace myself better.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
What proved to be useful was the various sources I can get my information from. Specifically, the various simlified videos online to get me started and then larger texts on canvas. These taught be to take initiative in my learning.

Week 2

What have I learnt this week?
I learnt this week how models make us better thinkers. It is said well on canvas under Introduction to many mdoel thinking "Models improve our ability to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies." Without this way of thinking and assistance from models I will struggle in my future career.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Mainly why we model. Models are a tool that is utilised by us to simplify the world to make it eaiser for us to understand. In saying this, I now know that learning about and how to use new tools will help me significantly in the future through work and school. Moreover, This tool can help me solve issues that previously would have been unsolved without the new understanding of this new tool. For example, There was a significant amount of financial transaction data where I was assisting at my local surfclub. being able to simplify down everything that was going on allowed me to assist in the problem.

What insights have I gained?
An insight that I have gained is the notion of why we model. As modelling is a great tool to utilise being able to understand and gain insight on why we model has assisted me in understanding my work at school but also implement this way of thinking into my daily life as stated before in the example above. Therefore, the insight of why we model has been gained by me and implemented into my life to help me with issues.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength that I have noticed when following up on my study through other sources was the ability to find what model I should use when faced with a problem. This ability has always put me closer to the solution as I know where to start. However, this is counteracted through a weakness that I have found in that I struggle with the creation of a model. This ironic issue does have an affect on how I solve issues as I need to consistently find sources to help me.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenge of sturggling to create models and do it effectively has been affecting my work. This was handled well as I asked my peers and administrators for help which signifcantly pushed me forward in understanding how to model effectively.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time would be to focus more on the making of modelling compared to why we model. Looking at my notes majority of them explain why we model. This is an issue as understanding why we model is quite straightforward compared to the more complicated making of models.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
What proved useful was the was the REDCAPE acronym. This acronym helped identify conditions in a model and also find logical implications of these models. Without this many aspects of my modelling and understanding of models would be vastly different.

Week 3

What have I learnt this week?
Similar to Week 1 what I learnt this week where the types of models and how I can utilise them. Specifically the rules based and behavioural models. These models broadened my understanding of models and how to use them.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Surprisingly, I found out that human nature is quite simple. Although I usually discover new types of modelling or thinking through my work. This week through the given models on modelling people I found out that we are all just systems and how simple the systems are. This had a drastic affect on my knowledge that I thought I had as these model simplify us and help us visualise the systems of humans. (what they were made to do.)

What insights have I gained?
An insight that I have gained is the importance of putting effort into my work. Throughout this week I have learned about new subjects such as the costly signalling theory that outlines how important it is to put effort into my work. It outlines how effort gives meaning and this meaning will make me want to work harder and better. This has the effect of imporving my work and thus gives me the insight of the importance of putting effort into my work.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength I observed was how putting effort into my work gives meaning and this meaning will make me want to work harder and better does infact make my work improve. However, I also noticed a weakness in that I have a fading motivation the longer the work goes on for leading to longer and longer breaks inbetween until finally I am just constantly procrastinating.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenge of procrastinating was significant during this week. I constantly sat in front of my work doing nothing and wasting time until I gave up and decided to do something else. This was overcome by clearing my head with something else such as exercise and finally shutting off and moving away from distractions until I could get my work done.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to stop the procrastinating earlier than I did. I still it linger and have the possibility of it coming up again. However, if I were to do beter next time I would shut off distractions early. This would have the result of finishing my work early to then relax.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The costly signalling theory was very interesting to me. It outlines the more effort put into something the more meaning it has. This is an interesting subject and proved to me useful as it outlines how we think. This would show up in my work as the more effort that is put in would give it more meaning further imporving my work as something that is meaningful will be worked on harder and thus better. Apart from learning how to ask girls out (swiping on tinder is not as good as asking someone out according to canvas.) I learned that putting effort into my work does improve it.

Week 4

What have I learnt this week?
The main thing I learned this week was representing human centred complex systems through system dynamics. The dynamics of a system help us further our understanding of systems as we learn about the main components and ways of thinking in systems. Mainly, System boundaries, system archetypes and thinking in systems. Similarly, I learned about parts of a systems model. These would later become important in the assignment.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that system dynamcis are very important in models and learning these characterisitcs help me to understand systems and how they work as well as how to read these systems. Reading these systems bring knowledge on what the system is trying to convey. ALthough I could visualise the system I can now read and see what it is conveying.

What insights have I gained?
The insights that I have gained are mainly a deeper understanding of the characteristics of systems and systems in models as system dynamics explore the notion of characterising parts of the system. This gives parts of the system a visual element that I can see what it is doing. This is an insight as it helps me see what parts of the system are doing what.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Some weaknesses that I have found during these weeks were the understanding of networks. Althought I had studied them during my highschool years coming back to Uni I had to relearn most of the content. Coming back I was struggling to make and understand them again as I was mixing up the ways you could move through networks and wrap my head around the new content in these networks. However, this weakness had turned into a stregnth as now I am back to my understanding of networks and making networks has never been eaiser.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Some challenges I encountered this week was getting around the computational aspect of agent based modelling. As we know agent based modelling usually revolves around being able to make a model simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. However, havig it be done on a computer most of the time this was an issue as I seem to struggle when learning about new aspects revolving around computers. In saying this, Having help from my peers helped me learn about new ways to help myself and get around this challenge.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is do the readings before my workshop. This week I had been caught up in other aspects of my life and did not read before my workshop. This became a bigger issue than I had expected leaving me having to catch up while I was listening. If I had further planned ahead this wekk would not have been an issue as much as it was.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
What proved to be useful this week was the logic of network formation. With this understanding of network formation it helped me further improve on my knowledge of networks as well as also help me work through this weeks challenge. What I have learnt from this is to back track on my notes when stuck as they definitely come in handy when faced with a challenge.

Week 5

What have I learnt this week?
This week a new subject was brought to be. Probability distributions. Althought I have previously studies distributions and probability alone, mixing these two was completely new to me.It brought a whole new outlook on the work I have been doing this semester. Similarly, I learned how this new subject can tie into statistics which I have been very fond of.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
What I know now that I did not know before are some of the mathematical formulas that can be integrated into probability distributions. These formulas assist in producing an output that can be expected with the distribution but also help us create a distribution to visualise what is to be expected.

What insights have I gained?
Insights that I have gained is a deeper understanding of the links between distribution and probability. As we know seperate they can be extremely useful to predict and help demonstrate spread in data. Intertwining these components significantly assist in how likely one can could find the possible values of random variable. This is phenominally helpful as it will help me in later modelling. Therefore, this insight of gaining a deeper understanding of the links between distribution and probability helps me later in my studies.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength I have observed was working with statistics. In canvas the "Dancing with Statistics" sub-heading was especially easy for me. Usually when coming across number related work I must take time to understand. However, this week it came with relative ease. However, A weakness that was when faced with a question it was hard for me to deduce what it was asking. When in the breakout rooms during the workshop while working as a team I found myself behind a little as a result of the question but once it was explained to me to work was done quickly.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As stated before a challenge that was faced this week was understanding questions during the workshop. Throughout my schooling career I have mainly only struggled on how to answer the question rather than what it was asking. I was not sure if this was one off but this week posed quite the challenge. However, due to the help of my peers in the breakout room they could explain what it was asking which helped me significantly to the point where I could answer the questions with relative ease.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Due to the need of having a peer explain the question. With hindsight I could've broken down the question and taken it slower. I'm not sure what happened this week but focussing and breaking down the question would have significantly changed the challenge of this week. In essence next time a slower approach would be better with anticipated results of answering the question eaiser.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that proved to be useful this week is the The mighty Central Limit Theorem which is a simple and effective model for aggregation of decisions in groups of people. This proved useful as we can use to make predictions about what will happen. Without this we would be making more a complicated analysis of data to get the same answer. What I have learned is that it is beneficial to find eaiser paths to get to the same answer.

Week 6

What have I learnt this week?
What I learned this week was the evolution of systems. In systems they can change through various outside impacts which can leave the need for a system to change to function properly. This is demonstrated through various canvas explainations on path dependance and the Urn model.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
To be straight forward, What I now know is that systems can evolve in the first place. At first I thought they were static and unchanging as a system that could change entirely could possibly stop functioning as a result of incompatible components. However, I know now that systems change all the time and can adapt.

What insights have I gained?
The inisght that I have gained is the furthered knowledge I have on systems. As stated before systems can change. This has flipped my view on systems and in essence changed what I thought I knew about systems. Therefore, through deepening my knowledge on systems I have gained an insight on my work in systems.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength I have observed this week is my ability to pick up on new information. For example, this new knowledge on systems encouraged me to deepen my knowledge on systems. However, this can also come as a weakness as I may find myself learning the wrong information.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge that I faced this week was getting behind the random walks. This week I was struggling as I could not understand what the sources where trying to convey. I believe it was due to the whole random aspect which was confusing me. However, After following sources online and re-reading some more content I believe I started to understand the concept.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better this week is getting my work done early. This week I had done my work later rather than sooner. This would have anticipated result of putting less stress on me as I would not have to worry about my work being done.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
What proved useful this week was Contagion: The SIR model. This model helped me understand how pathogens can spread and how to put them into the model. This was especially useful for me this week as it allowed me to understand our more recent Covid 19 outbreak. I have also learnt from this as it will help me significantly in my assignment where I have to model the Covid 19 outbreak in a model.

Week 7

What have I learnt this week?
What I have learnt this week is importance of great teamwork and chemistry. I realised now that others input is valid and important to me as it gives me a different perspective and helps me complete my goals. This week while working on the assignment as we work together I noticed how well people can work together which gave me the appreication for my group members.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I've always believed that work together is usually better. As demonstrated through the common saying "two minds are better than one." but now I know its true because I've truly experienced it this week. Usually people in the group are putting in minimal effort just enough to get the job done. However, now that I know my group members are putting in a great deal of effort and giving it meaning. I know that working together is better.

What insights have I gained?
An insight that I have gained is understanding the group dynamic. As everyone has their own personal lives and can be busy at times when I am not and vice versa. I have gained the insight that understanding how the group can function while facing various other aspects in lives is vital.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength I have observed this week is planning and being organised. As stated before many people in the group seem to be unable to find a good time to meet. However, getting on top of things and getting it done early significantly helped us in finding time to meet and work on the assignment. A weakness however, was the fact that we struggling to get the ball moving and start working straight away. This had an impact as the metting went on for longer than expect and we burnt out.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge that our group faced this week was the fact that we were getting distracted heavily at the start of our meeting. This was handled poorly as we continued to not work for an extended period of time which led to us burning out and getting tired with minimal work done.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time would be to take initiative and try to get the group working quickly so we can all go back to relaxing or go back to our distractions after the work was done.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Fisher's Theorem proved to be useful this week as it  allows us to combine the models. As stated we struggled to get a move on and work during our call. However, we all knew about this theorem and we could quickly implement it into our work allowing us to swiftly get the job done to start getting a move on. What I learned was that starting work can be very slow but taking small steps can finally get us to start working.

Week 8

What have I learnt this week?
What I learnt this week was the importance of cooperation. Althought I have noted that working together is important, this week I have learned the why. Through the various sources on canvas and the various videos on the prisoners dilemma I know know the why in why cooperation is important.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
What I now know about cooperation is that it is mutually beneifical for all of us to work together and complete our assignment. This is demonstrated through how we all want to get good marks in our assignment so we work together and use our stronger abilities to help those with weaker abilities in the field where we are stronger.

What insights have I gained?
An insight that I have gained is to be organised. This week I was away in queensland. This made it incredibly difficult to get my work done as I simply did not have time as a result of competing. If I had been more orgaised I could've got my work done before hand.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength that I observed was my ability to get on top of my work and catach up quickly. However, this is comes at a cost as I realised how much content I missed which led me to going back over everything. In essence, a weakness of mine was going to quickly which seems to be a reoccuring theme e.g. week 1 going to quickly.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I faced was the fact that I was away across the country. This left me with poor internet and a busy schedule competeing. However, was faced well as I caught up quickly as a result of my helpful peers.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is do my work before I go knowing that I am going to miss a weeks worth of work rather than try to do it when I am away and after. This would hopefully mitigate much off the stress or trying to do my work.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
What proved to be useful Collective Action problem. In the collective action problem if make a choice to contribute the contribution comes at a cost. This brought a new perspective on my group work throughout this week. For example, when I dont contribute because I am away it comes at a cost where the assignment does not get finished. This taught me that it is important to help out my group memebers as we all have a collcetive goal.

Week 9

What have I learnt this week?
What I have learnt this week is I should be asking questions in the Q and A’s as many aspects of my assignment would have been hard to work through. Without asking these questions to my administrators working on my assignment would have been more difficult as they can always just give me a straight out answer. This is demonstrated through understanding the coding and non coding options. Without understanding what was being asked me and my group would have been stuck figuring it out.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
What I now know is that there are no dumb questions. Althought it is a little cliche it is ok to ask simple questions as they can remove a big burden that may be holding you back in your study and your best.

What insights have I gained?
An insight that I have gained is that it is ok to ask questions even if they might be silly to ask. In saying this asking the questions that were silly seemed to calm me down with some issues that were stressing me a little bit so then I could more clearly ask more difficult questions. Without this, I may have been struggling with my assignment more.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A weakness I have noticed this week would be getting stressed over minimal issues. Getting stressed seems to have the effect of impacting my work negatively. However, this is counteracted by a technqiue I can use to my advantage (a strength you could say) where I take a break and do something that I enjoy that is relaxing e.g. watch youtube and have a drink. I turn this problem into a solution by calming myself down where I can work again

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge that I faced this week was getting on top of my other subjects as all my assignments needed to be done in close proximity. This was an issue as I need to be able to get all my classes done and still work on all my assignments at once. This was handled well as I could find allocated time to work on each of my assignments and still have them finished by the due date.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is start earlier on my assignments. It was not that I started late however I did not account for the fact that all my assignments would be due at the same time leaving progress for all of them slower than expected. Therefore, next time it would be in my best interest to start earlier.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
What proved to be useful was the help my administrators gave this week. Throughout this semester my administrators would always respond to my messages and questions that I have which was very beneficial as I could get answers to questions about work that would make me get stuck. What I have learnt is that people are there to help when you have an issue that you cannot solve.

week 11

What have I learnt this week?
What I have learnt this week is the importance of editing. During our project we have been constantly changing parts of the assignment. For example, the chosen Schelling model of segregation had to be rewritten by me as we as a group decided the stock and flow model was a better option. This was a continuous theme over the course of the project where various subjects such as the conceptual models section had to be constantly updated. However, without this editing many parts of the assingment would have been unreadable.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
What I now know is that without the editing and peer review much of my work could have been misinterpreted or straight out incorrect. Without my team’s overview and input this project would have been very difficult. For example, Aline and Lara offered to do the coding aspect of the assignment. Which would have left me stuck and unable to do that part of the assignment for which I am grateful for.

What insights have I gained?
An insight that I have gained is that my team members did great. We as a group worked together throughout the whole semester scheduling meetings and working through the project together. Therefore, the insight that I have gained is that the team members that I have were really helpful to complete the assingment.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A weakness that I noticed would be the fact that I have little coding experience. If I were to be allocated in a group where they wanted me to do the coding aspect of the assingment I would have struggled serverly. However, A strength that I observed would be the work that I did on models was stronger than my poor coding ability.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge that I encountered this week was the ability to find a quiet space. During this week there was work going on through my neighbour hood making it nearly impossible to get my work done as there was loud construction going on. This was handled poorly as I just decided not to work.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to go to a library as this would allow me to get my work done rather than just ignore it completely. This would have the anticipated result of getting my work done early where I have learned is better than not doing it at all.
