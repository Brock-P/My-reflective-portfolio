- Note Stuff that I have learned has been on a seperate document and updated.
Week 1 

What have I learnt this week?
I learnt this week what systems are and the types of systems. Mainly, the Main types of systems mainly complex adaptive systems and complicated systems. Similarly, how emergence can come from types on systems. An example of this is how ants can form a kind of a higher intelligence as they work together which can divert expectation as alone they are not as intelligent.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
How systems are all around us and constantly affect our day to day lives. Without systems many of our contemporary world ideals and structure would crumble without systems and its many properties. Furthermore, my way of thinking has changed to look into the details of a systems and its many components instead of looking at the system as a whole. Looking at the whole system can make it very complicated to visualise. 

What insights have I gained?
some insights that I have gained is to find the system boundary. As I am new to this way of thinking fiding the cut off in a system really helps me understand the system. An example of this was a practice question on a city system. As I tried to visualise and think about the system I found myself down the rabbit hole as I could not put a boundary on the system to help me answer the question. Moreover, the property of emergence has truly been deepened. As I found and interest on the subject further reading and learning really helped me understand how emergence can come of systems.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
As stated before I have a theme of overthinking the way a system works. In changing the way I think and making things simple I have found looking at systems to be much more eaiser than before. This understanding demonstrates both weakness through my overthinking but also strength as I over came this issue through the help of advisors and peers by thinking more simply. 

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
As this is my first lecture at Uni I found it to be quite the step up from previous learning. Especially the longer hours in classes. However, for me to understand the importance of learning and having my peers being in the same boat I focussed. This was handled to a good degree as we as a group create groups to contact each other for help.
A similar challenged faced was not knowing how to take notes. Considering the very long classes and more conversation, writing too much became an issue for me as I burned out quickly as I wrote too many notes. It was handled poorly through my stubborness to conitue writing too much burning me out qucikly.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time would be to pace myself. Being excited with my first class I seemed to have gone to quickly. Therefore, next time I would pace myself better.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
What proved to be useful was the various sources I can get my information from. Specifically, the various simlified videos online to get me started and then larger texts on canvas. These taught be to take initiative in my learning.

Week 2

What have I learnt this week?
I learnt this week how models make us better thinkers. It is said well on canvas under Introduction to many mdoel thinking "Models improve our ability to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies." Without this way of thinking and assistance from models I will struggle in my future career.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Mainly why we model. Models are a tool that is utilised by us to simplify the world to make it eaiser for us to understand. In saying this, I now know that learning about and how to use new tools will help me significantly in the future through work and school. Moreover, This tool can help me solve issues that previously would have been unsolved without the new understanding of this new tool. For example, There was a significant amount of financial transaction data where I was assisting at my local surfclub. being able to simplify down everything that was going on allowed me to assist in the problem.

What insights have I gained?
An insight that I have gained is the notion of why we model. As modelling is a great tool to utilise being able to understand and gain insight on why we model has assisted me in understanding my work at school but also implement this way of thinking into my daily life as stated before in the example above. Therefore, the insight of why we model has been gained by me and implemented into my life to help me with issues.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength that I have noticed when following up on my study through other sources was the ability to find what model I should use when faced with a problem. This ability has always put me closer to the solution as I know where to start. However, this is counteracted through a weakness that I have found in that I struggle with the creation of a model. This ironic issue does have an affect on how I solve issues as I need to consistently find sources to help me.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenge of sturggling to create models and do it effectively has been affecting my work. This was handled well as I asked my peers and administrators for help which signifcantly pushed me forward in understanding how to model effectively.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time would be to focus more on the making of modelling compared to why we model. Looking at my notes majority of them explain why we model. This is an issue as understanding why we model is quite straightforward compared to the more complicated making of models.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
What proved useful was the was the REDCAPE acronym. This acronym helped identify conditions in a model and also find logical implications of these models. Without this many aspects of my modelling and understanding of models would be vastly different.

Week 3

What have I learnt this week?
Similar to Week 1 what I learnt this week where the types of models and how I can utilise them. Specifically the rules based and behavioural models. These models broadened my understanding of models and how to use them.

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Surprisingly, I found out that human nature is quite simple. Although I usually discover new types of modelling or thinking through my work. This week through the given models on modelling people I found out that we are all just systems and how simple the systems are. This had a drastic affect on my knowledge that I thought I had as these model simplify us and help us visualise the systems of humans. (what they were made to do.)

What insights have I gained?
An insight that I have gained is the importance of putting effort into my work. Throughout this week I have learned about new subjects such as the costly signalling theory that outlines how important it is to put effort into my work. It outlines how effort gives meaning and this meaning will make me want to work harder and better. This has the effect of imporving my work and thus gives me the insight of the importance of putting effort into my work.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength I observed was how putting effort into my work gives meaning and this meaning will make me want to work harder and better does infact make my work improve. However, I also noticed a weakness in that I have a fading motivation the longer the work goes on for leading to longer and longer breaks inbetween until finally I am just constantly procrastinating.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenge of procrastinating was significant during this week. I constantly sat in front of my work doing nothing and wasting time until I gave up and decided to do something else. This was overcome by clearing my head with something else such as exercise and finally shutting off and moving away from distractions until I could get my work done.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to stop the procrastinating earlier than I did. I still it linger and have the possibility of it coming up again. However, if I were to do beter next time I would shut off distractions early. This would have the result of finishing my work early to then relax.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The costly signalling theory was very interesting to me. It outlines the more effort put into something the more meaning it has. This is an interesting subject and proved to me useful as it outlines how we think. This would show up in my work as the more effort that is put in would give it more meaning further imporving my work as something that is meaningful will be worked on harder and thus better. Apart from learning how to ask girls out (swiping on tinder is not as good as asking someone out according to canvas.) I learned that putting effort into my work does improve it.
